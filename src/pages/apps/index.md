[ROBOKOP](http://robokop.renci.org/) (**R**easoning **O**ver **B**iomedical **O**bjects linked in **K**nowledge **O**riented **P**athways) is a question-answering system that is built upon multiple open biomedical databases and designed to explore relationships between a variety of biomedical data types. Data are semantically integrated into a Knowledge Graph (KG). Users posit questions, such as: “What genes and biological processes explain the observed effect of the cancer drug imatinib on asthma?” ROBOKOP then locates applicable answer subgraphs in its KG and scores these putative answers, allowing users to view the results and supporting evidence (i.e., PubMed literature citations). Access to the [ROBOKOP KG](http://robokopkg.renci.org/) (**K**nowledge **G**raph) and downloadable copies are available at http://robokopkg.renci.org/. The [ROBOKOP KGB](https://github.com/NCATS-Gamma/robokop-interfaces) (**K**nowledge **G**raph **B**uilder) is the code that constructs the ROBOKOP KG. ROBOKOP KGB provides an extensible framework to handle graph query over and integration of federated data sources; it is available under the MIT software license from https://github.com/NCATS-Gamma/robokop-interfaces. See https://github.com/NCATS-Gamma/robokop/ and https://github.com/NCATS-Gamma/robokop-interfaces.

[ICEES](https://icees.renci.org/apidocs) (**I**ntegrated **C**linical and **E**nvironmental **E**xposures **S**ervice) provides open access to integrated clinical and environmental exposures data. The clinical data are derived from patients in the UNC Health Care System. The exposures data are derived from Green Team’s CMAQ Airborne Pollutant Exposures Service, US DOT Roadway Exposures Service, and US Census Bureau ACS Socio-environmental Exposures Service. A custom, geospatial- and time-based, data-conversion and -integration pipeline has been developed to support the creation of ‘ICEES integrated feature tables’.

[CAMP FHIR](https://github.com/empfff/CAMPFHIR) (**C**linical **A**sset **M**apping **P**rogram for **FHIR**) transforms clinical data from common data models (e.g., i2b2, PCORnet, OMOP) into HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) files. See https://github.com/NCTraCSIDSci/camp-fhir.

[FHIR PIT](https://github.com/xu-hao/datatrans) (**FHIR** **P**atient data **I**ntegration **T**ool) integrates FHIR-formatted clinical data with environmental exposures data from multiple sources before stripping Protected Health Information and binning feature variables to create ICEES integrated feature tables. FHIR PIT is modular and extensible and can be adapted for virtually any type of data that is of interest to researchers and requires geocodes, dates, and/or identifiers for integration. See API documentation and https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/icees-api/tree/master/docs.
 
[TranQL](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tdQbWofNJ8e_G-lTX030arRTioUJxohcBDaT2zGlh-M/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D) (**Tran**slator **Q**uery **L**anguage) is a new query language for expressing graph-oriented queries over the common knowledge interface presented by ROBOKOP and ICEES. TranQL offers a query and visualization interface to federated knowledge networks, with syntax that blends elements of relational and graph semantics and uses the [Biolink](https://github.com/biolink/) data model (an upper-level biomedical ontology) to express the graph query and enable joins across knowledge sources. See https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/tranql.

The [CMAQ Airborne Exposures API](http://bdt-cmaq.renci.org:8080/cmaq_exposures_api/v1/ui/) provides access to estimated airborne pollutant exposures, derived from the US EPA conUS dataset, for a given time period and spatial location of interest. Nationwide estimated exposures are available for years 2002–2014. The API currently provides access to data on the following airborne particulate exposures: estimated 8-hour maximum ozone concentration (ppb); and estimated average daily $PM_{2.5}$ concentration ($\mu g/m^3$). Nationwide average daily estimates for the following airborne exposures over the same time periods will be available in Summer 2019: CO, NO, NO2, NOx, SO2, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and benzene. See API documentation and https://github.com/lstillwe/cmaq-exposures-api.

The [US DOT Roadway Exposures API](http://bdt-proximity.renci.org:8080/roadway_proximity_api/v1/ui/) provides access to data on the distance in meters from a spatial location of interest to the nearest major (or primary) road types, including interstates, principal arteries, minor arteries, and major collector roads. In addition to distance, the API retrieves additional information, including the road type, the maximum speed limit, the annual average daily traffic (AADT), and the total number of lanes for the nearest road. Nationwide data are available for year 2016 and are derived from GIS shapefiles provided by the US DOT’s Federal Highway Administration, as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS). See API documentation and https://github.com/valenal/roadway-proximity-api.

The [US Census Bureau ACS Socio-Environmental Exposures API](http://bdt-social.renci.org:8080/socio_environmental_exposures_api/v1/ui/) provides access to data on select variables from the US Census Bureau’s American Community Service (ACS) for a spatial location of interest. Nationwide data are available at the census-block level from the 2012-2016 five-year survey sample on the following variables: EstTotalPop (estimated population count); EstTotalPop25Plus (estimated population count that are age 25 and older); EstPropPersons25PlusHighSchoolMax (estimated proportion of adults age 25 or higher with at most a high school degree); and EstPropPersons5PlusNoEnglish (estimated proportion of people speaking a language other than English at home); EstPropNonHispWhite (estimated proportion of households headed by non-Hispanic whites); MedianHouseholdIncome (estimated median household income); EstPropHouseholdsNoAuto (estimated proportion of adults without a car); and EstPropPersonsNoHealthIns (estimated proportion of adults without health insurance). See API documentation and https://github.com/lstillwe/socio-economic-api.

[Chemotext](http://chemotext.mml.unc.edu/) provides Medline/PubMed abstract co-occurrence of MeSH terms.

[OmniCorp](https://github.com/NCATS-Gamma/omnicorp&sa=D) provides an ontology-oriented evidence map. More specifically, OmniCorp annotates PubMed/Medline’s corpus of annotated abstracts with ontologies using Orange Team’s SciGraph. See https://github.com/NCATS-Gamma/omnicorp.

[BioNames](https://bionames.renci.org/apidocs/) provides a [Biolink](https://github.com/biolink/)-based lookup services to retrieve names from entity IDs or entity IDs from natural language names.
