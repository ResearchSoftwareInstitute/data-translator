## Translator as an Intuition Driver and Hypothesis Generator<a name="translator-as-a-intuition-driver: Ozone, Asthma, Autism?"></a>

KF is a translational scientist seeking to understand the health consequences of airborne pollutant exposure. As part of this effort, she used [ICEES](/apps/icees) to identify a significant association between exposure to ozone and frequent emergency or inpatient visits for respiratory issues among a defined subset of patients with asthma-like conditions. KF then used [ROBOKOP](/apps/robokop) to explore the mechanistic underpinnings of this relationship. Specifically, she ran an AOP structured as follows:

<p style="text-align: center;">ozone ⇨ gene ⇨ phenotypic</p>

feature. While exploring the answers, KF noticed something interesting: many of the answers included things like developmental process, nervous system development, abnormal sensory perception of sound, visual perception, abnormal peripheral nerve conduction, etc. This prompted a thought: might ozone be associated with asthma and autism? Sure enough, a subsequent search of PubMed revealed a small, but growing, recent body of work on the relationship between ozone and asthma. Moreover, a subsequent query of [ICEES](/apps/icees) revealed that $0.22\%$ of patients in the cohort of patients with asthma-like conditions had diagnoses of both asthma and ozone versus $0.043\%$ in the general population of patients at UNC Health Care System. The investigators are now using [TranQL](/apps/tranql) to explore a richer set of relationships between chemical exposures in [ICEES](/apps/icees) cohorts and AOPs in [ROBOKOP](/apps/robokop).
