The NCATS Data Translator is a digital knowledge platform for the exploration of translational science questions. With the Translator, we are able to combine knowledge distributed across a large number of research databases to model answers to non-trivial biomedical queries. The Translator methodology allows these questions to be approached in far less time than a human user would take to accomplish a similar result.

This site presents representative examples, the tools on the Translator platform used to address them, and the results achieved. In each case, we start with a high level overview of the question in biomedical terms. The examples then provide additional levels of detail ranging from conceptual methodology through tool usage, and eventually, the constituent knowledge sources employed.

The Translator is not a single application. Rather, it is a platform providing a framework of methods and patterns for incorporating data sources, approaches to the semantic integration of data from multiple sources, models for reasoning over that data, and client interfaces appropriate to a variety of user communities. It also instantiates a technical architecture including interfaces and standards promoting extensibility and scalability.
